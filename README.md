# Overview
It's an API on Echo framework.
My aim is to work with this framework and personal development.
There is a useful set of tools, which are described below.

## Inside:

- Registration and Authentication
- Registration and Authentication with Google
- CRUD API for posts, comments
- Migrations
- Request validation
- Swagger docs
- Environment configuration
- Docker development environment

## Test Routes
- I uploaded the finished api to the docker hub. By running the docker compose file in the root directory you can test it.
- I have also attached a postman file for your convenience.
- There is also a swagger specification you can run it in: http://localhost:8080/swagger/
